foswiki (1.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  In order to improve the package's security, Foswiki configuration
  script can now only be accessed at
  http://localhost/cgi-bin/foswiki/configure with an authentified HTTP
  session.

  This means that Foswiki configuration is only possible (in
  the default Debian package's apache configuration) :
   - through the Web interface, from the server's local accounts,
   - or by changing the /etc/foswiki/LocalSite.cfg file.

  The username and password for this 'configure' access are defined
  during package install (so-called "apache user" debconf questions,
  with a username by default 'admin').

  Note that contents of the NEWS.Debian file were removed as format was
  not good, and contents was redundant with README.Debian.
