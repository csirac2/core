Description: A Web Based Collaboration Platform
 Foswiki is a modern CGI-based implementation of the Wiki collaboration platform
 originally developed for OOP/Patterns collaboration.  In addition to the
 traditional Wiki feature of allowing any web browser to serve as a contributing
 client, Foswiki adds rcs-based version control and user management.

#Description: CPAN libraries for Foswiki
# This package should become unnecessary as all CPAN modules used by Foswiki
# become separately packaged and available in various Debian and Ubuntu
# releases. Ss a stopgap measure they are shipped in the Foswiki tarball
# and made available in this package.

Package: foswiki-configure-cgi

Architecture: all
Depends: ${perl:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Foswiki configure CGI
 The default upstream Foswiki uses a configure CGI to rewrite Apache and
 Foswiki configuration files.  This is dangerous and not recommended for
 .deb-based installs, but some extensions require this method of
 configuration.  The configure CGI is provided in this package, and changes
 permissions of several configuration files to www-data so they can be
 modified.  Don't install it unless you know you want or need it.

Description: Foswiki Apache2 site configuration

 You need to either manually configure Foswiki or choose on of the
 foswiki-configuration-* packages.

Package: foswiki-system-web-data
Architecture: all
Description: Foswiki System web
 This package directly supplies to Foswiki System web as root-owned files
 that cannot be editted through Foswiki.  This is the recommended way to
 keep an up-to-date Foswiki, so user edits do not need to be manually merged
 or lost on upgrades.

Package: foswiki-default-web-data
Architecture: all
Description: Foswiki System web
 This package directly supplies to Foswiki _default web used as a source
 when creating new unpopulated webs.  It is reasonable to uninstall this
 package and install your own modified _default web.

Package: foswiki-empty-web-data
Architecture: all
Depends: ${perl:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Foswiki _empty web
 This package directly supplies to Foswiki _empty web used as a source
 when creating new unpopulated webs.

Package: foswiki-example-data
Architecture: all
Description: Foswiki example core webs
 This contains the standard Foswiki seed tarball for creating new foswiki
 installations.  Once your Foswiki is installed and set up, you no longer
 need this seed data.
