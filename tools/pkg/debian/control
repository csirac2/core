Description: A Web Based Collaboration Platform
 Foswiki is a modern CGI-based implementation of the Wiki collaboration platform
 originally developed for OOP/Patterns collaboration.  In addition to the
 traditional Wiki feature of allowing any web browser to serve as a contributing
 client, Foswiki adds rcs-based version control and user management.

# Don't actually build this on modern Debian distributions
#Package: libfoswiki-cpan-perl
#Architecture: all
#Depends: ${perl:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
#Description: CPAN libraries for Foswiki
# This package should become unnecessary as all CPAN modules used by Foswiki
# become separately packaged and available in various Debian and Ubuntu
# releases. Ss a stopgap measure they are shipped in the Foswiki tarball
# and made available in this package.

Package: foswiki-configure-cgi
Architecture: all
Depends: ${perl:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, foswiki-core
Description: Foswiki configure CGI
 The default upstream Foswiki uses a configure CGI to rewrite Apache and
 Foswiki configuration files.  This is dangerous and not recommended for
 .deb-based installs, but some extensions require this method of
 configuration.  The configure CGI is provided in this package, but
 does not change permissions of several configuration files and content
 to www-data.  That must be done by hand at present to make configure CGI
 management work.  Don't install it unless you know you want or need it.

Package: foswiki-apache2
Provides: foswiki-configuration
Conflicts: foswiki-configuration
Architecture: all
Depends: ${perl:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, foswiki-core
Description: Foswiki Apache2 site configuration
 This is a simple Apache2 site configuration for testing and evaluation.
 By default it uses local .htaccess files for accounts, and may only
 be accessed from localhost.  The files it provides may be copied
 and modified for more open use, or another foswiki-configuration-*
 package may be installed instead.

Package: foswiki-system-web-data
Architecture: all
Depends: foswiki-core
Description: Foswiki System web
 This package directly supplies to Foswiki System web as root-owned files
 that cannot be editted through Foswiki.  This is the recommended way to
 keep an up-to-date Foswiki, so user edits do not need to be manually merged
 or lost on upgrades.

Package: foswiki-default-web-data
Architecture: all
Depends: foswiki-core
Description: Foswiki System web
 This package directly supplies to Foswiki _default web used as a source
 when creating new unpopulated webs.  It is reasonable to uninstall this
 package and install your own modified _default web.

Package: foswiki-empty-web-data
Architecture: all
Depends: foswiki-core
Description: Foswiki _empty web
 This package directly supplies to Foswiki _empty web used as a source
 when creating new unpopulated webs.

Package: foswiki-example-data
Architecture: all
Depends: foswiki-core
Description: Foswiki example core webs
 This contains the standard Foswiki seed tarball for creating new foswiki
 installations.  Once your Foswiki is installed and set up, you no longer
 need this seed data.
