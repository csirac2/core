 Foswiki includes a complete "starter kit" which includes user
 registration pages, documentation, and tutorials.

 update the distributed files manually. Upgrading will only update 
 topics that have not been  modified through the wiki.

 /usr/share/foswiki/foswiki-data.tar.gz (and foswiki-pub.tar.gz) if you
 want to install it manually or compare the topics with the new
 version.
