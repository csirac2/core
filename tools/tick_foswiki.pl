# It executes a number of non-essential regular administration
# tasks that will help keep your Foswiki healthy and happy.

# It is intended to be run as a cron job (remember it has to be run
# by a user who can write files created by the webserver user!)
# For example,

# 0 0 * * 0 cd /usr/foswiki/bin && perl ../tools/tick_foswiki.pl
