Run this script from a directory with a MANIFEST file, or from a top level of
an extension, or from within an extension, passing the path of the MANIFEST as
first parameter.

The script will find and scan MANIFEST and compare the contents with what is
checked in under $cvs. Any differences are reported.

It will also compare permissions given in the MANIFEST with permissions which
are on disk.
