Change the "shebang" lines of all perl scripts found either in the current
directory or as configured in @directories. Default is to change:
../tools and ../bin directories. You will be asked to confirm accordingly.

"shebang" lines tell the shell what interpreter to use for running scripts.
By default the Foswiki bin scripts are set to use the "/usr/bin/perl"
interpreter, which is where perl lives on most UNIX-like platforms. On some
platforms you will need to change this line to run a different interpreter
e.g. "D:\indigoperl\bin\perl" or "/usr/bin/speedy"

This script will change the "shebang" lines of all scripts found in the
confirmed directories except for itself.

Note: the path to the interpreter *must not* contain any spaces.
