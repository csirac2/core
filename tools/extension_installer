---+ extension_installer
This is a generic installer script. The basic function of this script is to
locate an archive and unpack it. 

It is called as any of the named package installers, with the addition of the
Extension name to be installed as the first parameter to the command.  It 
*must* be run from the root of the Foswiki installation

| *Function* | *Dedicated Package* | *Generic Installer* |
| Install | =perl MyExtension_installer= | =perl tools/extension_installer MyExtension |
| uninstall | =perl MyExtension_installer uninstall= | =perl tools/extension_installer MyExtension uninstall |
| Manifest | =perl MyExtension_installer manifest= | =perl tools/extension_installer MyExtension manifest |
| Dependencies | =perl MyExtension_installer dependencies= | =perl tools/extension_installer MyExtension dependencies |

The script also functions as an *uninstaller* by passing the parameter
=uninstall= on the command-line. Note that uninstallation does *not* revert
the history of any topic changed during the installation.
