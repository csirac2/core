# LocalLib.cfg: local path settings for Foswiki

# -------------- Path to lib directory containing Foswiki.pm. 
#
# REQUIRED
# The absolute path to the 'lib' directory in your installation..

$foswikiLibPath = "/absolute/path/to/your/lib";


# -------------- Extra path components to include in @INC
# OPTIONAL
# If you need to use perl modules that are not installed in the standard
# directories (e.g. you have downloaded extra modules for use with plugins)
# then you can add the absolute paths to those modules below. You can list
# as many directories as you want, each directory within quotes, and 
# directories separated by commas.

# @localPerlLibPath = ( '/path/to/dir', '/path/to/another/dir', );


# OPTIONAL
# If you want to remove some paths from Foswiki @INC (e.g. you whish to
# ensure no other system wide perl installation will interfere with
# your local perl version) then add absolute paths to be removed below.
# You can list as many directories as you want, each directory within
# quotes, and directories separated by commas.

# no lib ( '/path/to/dir', '/path/to/another/dir', );


# HINTS
# If you prefer to have each path on a single line then you could add a
# linebreak instead of the spaces between the parentheses e.g.:
# <above OPTIONAL setting> (
#       '/path/to/dir',
#       '/path/to/another/dir',
#       );


# http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/04/10/mod_perl.html?page=3 has good advice
# on installing CPAN modules without superuser privileges.
# http://sial.org/howto/perl/life-with-cpan/non-root/ also provides a good
# overview and especially mentions additional modules interesting for
# non-root installations (e.g. App::perlbrew, local::lib, App::FatPacker,
# App::cpanminus and other tools).
