# Configuration of Foswiki - The Free and Open Source Wiki, http://foswiki.org/
# See bottom of file for license and copyright information.

# This specification file is held in 'foswiki/lib' directory. DO NOT EDIT
# THIS FILE!

# DO NOT COPY THIS FILE TO LocalSite.cfg - Run configure from your browser
# which will guess required settings, merge the files and write a new
# LocalSite.cfg.

# If for some reason you still want to copy this file to LocalSite.cfg,  you
# must un-comment and complete the 10 PATH and URLPATH settings that are flagged
# as Mandatory ( M** ) and remove the __END__ line toward the end of the file.

# Manually building LocalSite.cfg is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.

# See 'setlib.cfg' in the 'bin' directory for how to configure a non-standard
# include path for Perl modules.
#
# Note that the comments in this file are formatted specifically so
# that the 'configure' script can extract documentation from here. See
# http://foswiki.org/System/DevelopingPlugins#Integrating_with_configure
# for details of the syntax used.
#
# NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS: you can use $Foswiki::cfg variables in other settings,
# but you must be sure they are only evaluated under program control and
# not when this file is loaded. For example:
## $Foswiki::cfg{Blah} = "$Foswiki::cfg{DataDir}/blah.dat"; # BAD
## $Foswiki::cfg{Blah} = '$Foswiki::cfg{DataDir}/blah.dat'; # GOOD

# Note that the general path settings are deliberately commented out.
# This is because they *must* be defined in LocalSite.cfg, and *not* here.

#---+ General path settings
# <p><strong>If you are a first-time installer:</strong> once you have set
# up the eight paths below, your wiki should work - try it. You can
# always come back and tweak other settings later.</p>
# <p><b>Security Note:</b> Only the URL paths listed below should
# be browseable from the web. If you expose any other directories (such as
# lib or templates) you are opening up routes for possible hacking attempts.</p>

# **URL M**
#  This is the root of all Foswiki URLs e.g. http://myhost.com:123.
# $Foswiki::cfg{DefaultUrlHost} = 'http://your.domain.com';

# **STRING**
# If your host has aliases (such as both www.mywiki.net and mywiki.net
# and some IP addresses) you need to tell Foswiki that redirecting to them
# is OK. Foswiki uses redirection as part of its normal mode of operation
# when it changes between editing and viewing.
# To prevent Foswiki from being used in phishing attacks and to protect it
# from middleman exploits, the security setting {AllowRedirectUrl} is by
# default disabled, restricting redirection to other domains. If a redirection
# to a different host is attempted, the target URL is compared against this
# list of additional trusted sites, and only if it matches is the redirect
# permitted.<br />
# Enter as a comma separated list of URLs (protocol, hostname and (optional)
# port) e.g. <code>http://your.domain.com:8080,https://other.domain.com</code>
$Foswiki::cfg{PermittedRedirectHostUrls} = '';

# **URLPATH M**
# This is the 'cgi-bin' part of URLs used to access the Foswiki bin
# directory e.g. <code>/foswiki/bin</code><br />
# Do <b>not</b> include a trailing /.
# <p />
# See <a href="http://foswiki.org/Support/ShorterUrlCookbook" target="_new">ShorterUrlCookbook</a> for more information on setting up
# Foswiki to use shorter script URLs.  The setting for the <code>view</code> script may be adjusted below.  Other scripts need to 
# be manually added to <code>lib/LocalSite.cfg</code>
# $Foswiki::cfg{ScriptUrlPath} = '/foswiki/bin';

# **URLPATH M**
# This is the complete path used to access the Foswiki view script including any suffix.  Do not include a trailing /.
# (This is an exception override, so the ScriptSuffix is not automatically added.) 
# e.g. <code>/foswiki/bin/view.pl</code><br />  Note:  The default is acceptable except when shorter URLs are used.
# <p />
# If you are using Shorter URL's, then this is typically set to the base path of your wiki, which should be the value 
# of {ScriptUrlPath} excluding <code>/bin</code>. e.g. if your {ScriptUrlPath} is either empty or set to <code>/bin</code> leave 
# <code>{ScriptUrlPaths}{view}</code> empty; if it is set to something like <code>/directory/bin</code> set it to <code>/directory</code>
# <p />
# Do not change
# this unless your Web Server configuration has been set to use shorter URLs.  See also the Foswiki
# <a href="http://foswiki.org/Support/ApacheConfigGenerator" target="_new">Apache Config Generator</a> and
# <a href="http://foswiki.org/Support/ShorterUrlCookbook" target="_new">Shorter URL Cookbook</a>

# $Foswiki::cfg{PubUrlPath} = '/foswiki/pub';

# **NUMBER EXPERT**
# This is the maximum number of files and directories that will be checked 
# for permissions for the pub and data Directory paths.  This limit is initially set to 
# 5000, which should be reasonable for a default installation.  If it is 
# exceeded, then an informational message is returned stating that incomplete
# checking was performed.  If this is set to a large number on large installations,
# then a significant delay will be incurred when configure is run, due to the 
# recursive directory checking.

# **PATH M**
# Directory where Foswiki stores files that are required for the management
# of Foswiki, but are not required to be browsed from the web.

# </ul>
# For obvious reasons, these files must <b>not</b> be browseable from the web!
# Additionally you are recommended to restrict access rights to this directory
# so only the web server user can create files.</li>
# <li>{WorkingDir}<tt>/work_areas</tt> - these are work areas used by

#---+ Security and Authentication -- TABS
# <p>In order to support tracking who changed what, and apply access controls,
# Foswiki is normally configured to use logins. The tabs below control
# various aspects of logins.</p>
#---++ Sessions
# <p>Sessions are how Foswiki tracks a user across multiple requests.
# A user's session id is stored in a cookie, and this is used to identify
# the user for each request they make to the server.
# You can use sessions even if you are not using login.
# This allows you to have persistent session variables - for example, skins.
# Client sessions are not required for logins to work, but Foswiki will not
# be able to remember logged-in users consistently.
# See <a href="http://foswiki.org/System/UserAuthentication" target="_new">User 
# Authentication</a> for a full discussion of the pros and
# cons of using persistent sessions.</p>

# **BOOLEAN**
# Control whether Foswiki will use persistent sessions.
$Foswiki::cfg{UseClientSessions} = 1;

# **STRING 20**
# Set the session timeout, in seconds. The session will be cleared after this
# amount of time without the session being accessed. The default is 6 hours
# (21600 seconds).<p />
# <b>Note</b> By default, session expiry is done "on the fly" by the same
# processes used to
# serve Foswiki requests. As such it imposes a load on the server. When
# there are very large numbers of session files, this load can become
# significant. For best performance, you can set {Sessions}{ExpireAfter}
# to a negative number, which will mean that Foswiki won't try to clean
# up expired sessions using CGI processes. Instead you should use a cron
# job to clean up expired sessions. The standard maintenance cron script
# <tt>tools/tick_foswiki.pl</tt> includes this function.
# <p /> Session files are stored in the <tt>{WorkingDir}/tmp</tt> directory.
$Foswiki::cfg{Sessions}{ExpireAfter} = 21600;

# **NUMBER EXPERT**
# TemplateLogin only.
# Normally the cookie that remembers a user session is set to expire
# when the browser exits, but using this value you can make the cookie
# expire after a set number of seconds instead. If you set it then
# users will be able to tick a 'Remember me' box when logging in, and
# their session cookie will be remembered even if the browser exits.<p />
# This should always be the same as, or longer than, {Sessions}{ExpireAfter},
# otherwise Foswiki may delete the session from its memory even though the
# cookie is still active.<p />
# A value of 0 will cause the cookie to expire when the browser exits.
# One month is roughly equal to 2600000 seconds.
$Foswiki::cfg{Sessions}{ExpireCookiesAfter} = 0;

# **BOOLEAN EXPERT**
# If you have persistent sessions enabled, then Foswiki will use a cookie in
# the browser to store the session ID. If the client has cookies disabled,
# then Foswiki will not be able to record the session. As a fallback, Foswiki
# can rewrite local URLs to pass the session ID as a parameter to the URL.
# This is a potential security risk, because it increases the chance of a
# session ID being stolen (accidentally or intentionally) by another user.
# If this is turned off, users with cookies disabled will have to
# re-authenticate for every secure page access (unless you are using
# {Sessions}{MapIP2SID}).
$Foswiki::cfg{Sessions}{IDsInURLs} = 0;

# **BOOLEAN EXPERT**
# It is possible to enable a check that the user trying to use a session
# is on the same IP address that was used when the session was created.
# This gives a small increase in security. Public web sites can easily be
# accessed by different users from the same IP address when they access
# through the same proxy gateway, meaning that the protection is limited.
# Additionally, people get more and more mobile using a mix of LAN, WLAN, 
# and 3G modems and they will often change IP address several times per day.
# For these users IP matching causes the need to re-authenticate all the time.
# IP matching is therefore disabled by default and should only be enabled if
# you are sure the users IP address never changes during the lifetime of a
# session.
$Foswiki::cfg{Sessions}{UseIPMatching} = 0;

# **BOOLEAN EXPERT**
# For compatibility with older versions, Foswiki supports the mapping of the
# clients IP address to a session ID. You can only use this if all
# client IP addresses are known to be unique.
# If this option is enabled, Foswiki will <b>not</b> store cookies in the
# browser.
# The mapping is held in the file $Foswiki::cfg{WorkingDir}/tmp/ip2sid.
# If you turn this option on, you can safely turn {Sessions}{IDsInURLs}
# <i>off</i>.
$Foswiki::cfg{Sessions}{MapIP2SID} = 0;

# **STRING 20 EXPERT**
# By default the Foswiki session cookie is only accessible by the host which
# sets it. To change the scope of this cookie you can set this to any other
# value (ie. company.com). Make sure, Foswiki can access its own cookie. <br />
# If empty, this defaults to the current host.
$Foswiki::cfg{Sessions}{CookieRealm} = '';

# **SELECT strikeone,embedded,none **
# <p>By default Foswiki uses Javascript to perform "double submission" validation
# of browser requests. This technique, called "strikeone", is highly
# recommended for the prevention of cross-site request forgery (CSRF). See also 
# <a href="http://foswiki.org/Support/WhyYouAreAskedToConfirm" target="_new">
# Why am I being asked to confirm?</a>.</p>
# <p>If Javascript is known not to be available in browsers that use the site,
# or cookies are disabled, but you still want validation of submissions,
# then you can fall back on a embedded-key validation technique that
# is less secure, but still offers some protection against CSRF. Both
# validation techniques rely on user verification of "suspicious"
# transactions.</p>
# <p>This option allows you to select which validation technique will be
# used.<br />
# If it is set to "strikeone", or is undefined, 0, or the empty string, then
# double-submission using Javascript will be used.<br />
# If it is set to "embedded", then embedded validation keys will be used.<br/>
# If it is set to "none", then no validation of posted requests will
# be performed.</p>
$Foswiki::cfg{Validation}{Method} = 'strikeone';

# **NUMBER EXPERT**
# Validation keys are stored for a maximum of this amount of time before
# they are invalidated. Time in seconds.
$Foswiki::cfg{Validation}{ValidForTime} = 3600;

# **NUMBER EXPERT**
# The maximum number of validation keys to store in a session. There is one
# key stored for each page rendered. If the number of keys exceeds this
# number, the oldest keys will be force-expired to bring the number down.
$Foswiki::cfg{Validation}{MaxKeysPerSession} = 1000;

# **BOOLEAN EXPERT**
# Expire a validation key immediately when it is used to validate the saving
# of a page. This protects against an attacker evesdropping the communication
# between browser and server and exploiting the keys sent from browser to
# server. If this is enabled and a user edits and saves a page, and then goes
# back to the edit screen using the browser back button and saves again, they
# will be met by a warning screen against "Suspicious request from
# browser". The same warning will be displayed if you build an application with
# pages containing multiple forms and users try to submit from these
# forms more than once. If this warning screen is a problem for your users, you
# can disable this setting which enables reuse of validation keys.
# However this will lower the level of security against cross-site request
# forgery.

# <li>Copy the <tt>FastReport</tt> page from <a href="http://foswiki.org/Extensions/FastReport?raw=on" target="_new">Foswiki:Extensions.FastReport</a> to your new web</li>
# <li> Set the <tt>WEBFORMS</tt> preference in WebPreferences to <tt>PackageForm</tt></li>

# The search list is a semicolon-separated list of repository specifications, each in the format: <i>name=(listurl,puburl,username,password)</i>
# where:
# <ul>
# <li><code>name</code> is the symbolic name of the repository e.g. Foswiki.org</li>
# <li><code>listurl</code> is the root of a view URL</li>
# <li><code>puburl</code> is the root of a download URL</li>
# <li><code>username</code> is the username if TemplateAuth is required on the repository (optional)</li>
# <li><code>password</code> is the password if TemplateAuth is required on the repository (optional)</li>
# </ul>
# Note: if your Repository uses ApacheAuth, embed the username and password into the listurl as <code>?username=x;password=y</code>
# <p />
# For example,<code>
# twiki.org=(http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/,http://twiki.org/p/pub/Plugins/); foswiki.org=(http://foswiki.org/Extensions/,http://foswiki.org/pub/Extensions/);</code><p />
# For Extensions with the same name in more than one repository, the <strong>last</strong> matching repository in the list will be chosen, so Foswiki.org should always be last in the list for maximum compatibility.
