=begin TML
---++ DEBUG
Constant indicating whether asserts are currently active. This constant is
set at the start of the program run from the environment variable
FOSWIKI_ASSERTS.

---++ ASSERT(condition [, message]) if DEBUG
Assert that =condition= returns true. =message= is used to generate a 'friendly'
error message if it is provided. The =if DEBUG= is required to give the perl
optimiser a chance to eliminate this function call if asserts are not enabled.

---++ TAINT($val) -> $var
Generate a tainted version of the variable with the same value.

---++ UNTAINTED($val) -> $boolean
Return true if the vaue passed is untainted.
