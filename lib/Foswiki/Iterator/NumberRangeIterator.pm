=begin TML

---+ package Foswiki::Iterator::NumberRangeIterator

Iterator over a range of integer values, with programmable increment.

=begin TML

---++ ClassMethod new($start, $end, $inc)
Construct a new iterator from start to end step inc.
The range is inclusive i.e. if $end == $start, you will get an iterator
that returns a single value.

The iteration step is the absolute value of $inc, and defaults to 1.
