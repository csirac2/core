# ****
# CGI.pm has a private class called CGITempFile which is used to hold
# a handle to a temporary file. The idea is that when the CGI object
# is reaped, the temporary files are automatically unlinked. However,
# when Sandbox::sysCommand is invoked - for example, by loading a topic
# before the uploads have been processed - a subprocess is created that
# gets a copy of the parent process, including these objects. When the
# subprocess terminates, the CGITempFiles are DESTROYed and the external
# files unlinked, leaving the parent process with pointers to non-
# existant temporary files.
#
# We solve this problem by patching the DESTROY method on CGITempFile so
# that the temporary files are only ever destroyed by the parent process,
# and never by the child. We do this by comparing the PID with a PID
# recorded when the CGI object is constructed.
