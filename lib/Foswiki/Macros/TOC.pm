# SMELL: this is _not_ a tag handler in the sense of other builtin tags,
# because it requires far more context information (the text of the topic)
# than any handler.
# SMELL: as a tag handler that also semi-renders the topic to extract the
# headings, this handler would be much better as a preRenderingHandler in
# a plugin (where head, script and verbatim sections are already protected)

# Handles %<nop>TOC{...}% syntax.  Creates a table of contents
# using Foswiki bulleted
# list markup, linked to the section headings of a topic. A section heading is

#    * $headingPatternDa : ---++... dashes section heading
#    * $headingPatternHt : &lt;h[1-6]> HTML section heading &lt;/h[1-6]>
