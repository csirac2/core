<h3>Is this your first visit to Configure?</h3>
<p>
First thing you need to do is set the paths to your installation.<br/>
We have guessed most settings for now.</p>
<ol>
	<li>please go over the settings and make changes if necessary</li>
	<li>save and come back here to complete your installation</li>

</ol>
<h3>Not your first time?</h3>
<p>
If you did save settings before, something went wrong. Possibly the file <code>lib/LocalSite.cfg</code> could not be read.</p>
<p>Please continue with <a href='http://foswiki.org/System/InstallationGuide#Troubleshooting'>Troubleshooting your installation.</a>
