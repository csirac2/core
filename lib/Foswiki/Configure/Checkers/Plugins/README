This is the directory where you should find checkers for plugins.

For example, if you wanted a configure checker on
$Foswiki::cfg{Plugins}{MyPlugin}{Enabled}, you would create MyPlugin/Enabled.pm
under this directory.

This README file has been added so that this directory is not empty, a cheap
work-around to a pseudo-install flaw, see http://foswiki.org/Tasks/Item10860

This file doesn't need to be shipped in official Foswiki releases
