---+ package Foswiki::Configure::Valuer
A container for configuration data values. This class is used to refer
to two hashes of configuration values. The first is a hash of default
values, and the second (which will have mostly the same keys) contains
the *current* value (i.e. the value after any edits have been applied).

=cut

package Foswiki::Configure::Valuer;

use strict;
use warnings;

use Foswiki::Configure::Type ();

=begin TML

---++ ClassMethod new($defaults, $values)

$defaults is a reference to the raw hash of defaults ($Foswiki::cfg, as
taken from Foswiki.spec + Config.spec)

$values is a reference to the hash of current values (also $Foswiki::cfg,
but as taken from Foswiki.spec + Config.spec + LocalSite.cfg)

        # but the probability of this string occurring elsewhere than an

=begin TML

---++ ObjectMethod loadCGIParams($query, \%updated)

Get changed values from CGI. Each parameter is identified by a
TYPEOF: param that specifies the keys e.g. ?TYPEOF:{Kiss}=Smooch. The
type is used to determine if the value of {Kiss} in CGI is different to
the value known to the Valuer (i.e. has been updated). If it is, the keys
are added to the $updated hash.

    # pick up those things that we really want

        # e.g. {Languages}{'zh-cn'}.
