package Foswiki::Configure::UIs::Root;

=begin TML

---+ package Foswiki::Configure::UIs::Root

Specialisation of Foswiki::Configure::UIs::Section for the root
of the model.

The root differs from other sections in that it carries the
Foswiki::Configure::Valuer used to give values to configuration items,
and is itself a visitor over the model. As each node in the model
is visited, the UI for that node is loaded.

---++ ObjectMethod messages($message)

Set and retrieve the messages from the previous operation. Also passes through sanity errors.

If called with a message, sets and returns the message, otherwise just returns the message

Visit the nodes in a tree of configuration items, and generate
their UIs.
