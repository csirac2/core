# A UI for a collection object, designed so the objects can be twisted.
# The UI is implemented by visiting the nodes of the configuration and
# invoking the open-html and close_html methods for each node. The
# layout of a configuration page is depth-sensitive, so we have slightly
# different behaviours for each of level 0 (the root), level 1 (twisty
# sections) and level > 1 (subsection).
