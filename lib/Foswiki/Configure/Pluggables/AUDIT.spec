# This file defines the AUDIT groups
#
# The object of groups is to have a small number of buttons that do a large number
# of checks.  They should all fit on a reasonably sized screen - so more buttons in
# one heading is preferable to lots of subheadings with one button each.
#
# But logical organization is important, too.  Bottons left to right should either
# be partitions of a heading, or increasing test strength/repair impact.
#
# Syntax:
# Lines can be arbitrarily long, or continued with \.  Leading whitespace on continuation
# lines is ignored, but space before the \ is significant.
#
# Blank lines are ignored.
#
# #! Comments (anywhere in file)
#
# # Comment lines (after this first block) are added to item/section descriptions.
#   As with Foswiki/Config.spec, this is HTML text.
#   Note that unlike Foswiki/Config.spec, description for items FOLLOWs the item
#   declaration.
#
# #---++ heading text -- options
#        Top level section heading - more +s for deeper levels
# {key}{s} [G:b G:b] [type] options
#        Defines an audit group.
#        {Key}{s} are the hash keys used to find the AuditGroup handler for this group
#                 There are checkers (Foswiki::Configure::Checkers::Key::s) for each group.
#                 Normally, these would be null derrivations from AUDITGROUP, but other things are possible.
#        G:b are the GroupName of the parameters to be audited, and the Audit Button number
#                 that is pressed to select that group.
#                 GroupNames _* are reserved for internal functions.  _none is used for environment data
#                 not directly related to any item.
#        type is the TYPE used to display the item.  Usually NULL, but can be any item in Types;
#                 e.g. when an audit produces a short result.  Defaults to NULL.
#        options are the usual item options - note that AUDIT is usually meaningless for
#                 these items (except when they have dual auditor/item roles),
#                 but FEEDBACK is used to define an audit button, CHECK and LABEL are also meaningful.

# provider, as these environments are frequently misconfigured or running out-of-date software.
# <p>When you click <strong>Analyze Environment</strong>, configure tests PATH_INFO
# by making a special request to itself with known PATH_INFO. Configure verifies that
# it receives the correct information from the webserver.
