=begin TML

---+ package Foswiki::LineIterator
*implements* Foswiki::Iterator

Iterator over the lines read from a file handle.

=cut

package Foswiki::LineIterator;

use strict;

use Foswiki::Iterator ();
our @ISA = ('Foswiki::Iterator');

=begin TML

---++ new( $fh )

Create a new iterator over the given file handle.

=cut

sub new {
    my ( $class, $fh ) = @_;
    my $this = bless(
        {
            nextLine => undef,
            handle   => $fh,
        },
        $class
    );
    Foswiki::LineIterator::next($this);
    $this->{process} = undef;
    $this->{filter}  = undef;

    return $this;
}

=begin TML

---++ hasNext() -> $boolean

Returns false when the iterator is exhausted.

<verbatim>
my $it = new Foswiki::ListIterator(\@list);
while ($it->hasNext()) {
   ...
</verbatim>

=cut

sub hasNext {
    my $this = shift;
    return defined( $this->{nextLine} );
}

=begin TML

---++ next() -> $data

Return the next line in the file.

The iterator object can be customised to pre- and post-process entries from
the list before returning them. This is done by setting two fields in the
iterator object:

   * ={filter}= can be defined to be a sub that filters each entry. The entry
     will be ignored (next() will not return it) if the filter returns false.
   * ={process}= can be defined to be a sub to process each entry before it
     is returned by next. The value returned from next is the value returned
     by the process function.

For example,
<verbatim>
my $it = new Foswiki::LineIterator("/etc/passwd");
$it->{filter} = sub { $_[0] =~ /^.*?:/; return $1; };
$it->{process} = sub { return "User $_[0]"; };
while ($it->hasNext()) {
    my $x = $it->next();
    print "$x\n";
}
</verbatim>

=cut

sub next {
    my ($this) = @_;
    my $curLine = $this->{nextLine};
    local $/ = "\n";
    while (1) {
        my $h = $this->{handle};
        $this->{nextLine} = <$h>;
        if ( !defined( $this->{nextLine} ) ) {
            last;
        }
        else {
            chomp( $this->{nextLine} );
        }
        last if !$this->{filter};
        last unless &{ $this->{filter} }( $this->{nextLine} );
    }
    $curLine = &{ $this->{process} }($curLine)
      if defined $curLine && $this->{process};
    return $curLine;
}

# See Foswiki::Iterator for a description of the general iterator contract
sub reset {
    my ($this) = @_;

    return;
}
