---+ package Foswiki::Store::RcsWrap

Implementation of =Foswiki::Store= for stores that use the RCS version
control system to manage disk files. This class inherits most of its
functionality from =Foswiki::Store::VCStore=, which it shares with
=Foswiki::Store::RcsLite=.

For readers who are familiar with Foswiki version 1.0, this class
has no equivalent in Foswiki 1.0. The equivalent of the old
=Foswiki::Store::RcsWrap= is the new =Foswiki::Store::RcsWrapHandler=.

# class during construction, so that the core can simply say "give me a new
# XXX store" without having to pass additional parameters.
