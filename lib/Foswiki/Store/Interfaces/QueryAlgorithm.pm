---+ package Foswiki::Store::Interfaces::QueryAlgorithm

Interface to query algorithms.
Implementations of this interface are found in Foswiki/Store/QueryAlgorithms.

The contract with query algorithms is specified by this interface description,
plus the 'query' unit tests in Fn_SEARCH.
The interface provides a default implementation of the 'getField' method,
but all other methods are pure virtual and must be provided by subclasses.
Note that if a subclass re-implements getField, then there is no direct
need to inherit from this class (as long as all the methods are implemented).

---++ StaticMethod query( $query, $webs, $inputTopicSet, $session, $options ) -> $infoCache
   * =$query= - A Foswiki::Query::Node object
   * =$web= - name of the web being searched, or may be an array reference
              to a set of webs to search
   * =$inputTopicSet= - iterator over names of topics in that web to search
   * =$session= - reference to the store object
   * =$options= - hash of requested options
This is the top-level interface to a query algorithm. A store module can call
this method to start the 'hard work' query process. That process will call
back to the =getField= method in this module to evaluate leaf data in the
store.

To monitor the hoisting and evaluation processes, use the MONITOR_EVAL
setting in Foswiki::Query::Node

---++ StaticMethod getField($class, $node, $data, $field ) -> $result
   * =$class= is this package
   * =$node= is the query node
   * =$data= is the indexed object
   * =$field= is the scalar being used to index the object
=getField= is used by the query evaluation code in Foswiki::Query::Node to get
information about a leaf node, or 'field'. A field can be a name, or a literal,
and the information it refers to can be a scalar, a reference to a hash, or
a reference to an array. The exact interpretation of fields is
context-dependant, according to reasonably complex rules best documented by
the Fn_SEARCH unit test and System.QuerySearch.

The function must map the query schema to whatever the underlying
store uses to store a topic. See System.QuerySearch for more information
on the query schema.
