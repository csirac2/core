=begin TML

---+ package Foswiki::Iterator

This class cannot be instantiated on its own - it is an interface
specification for iterators. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_Pattern
for more information on the iterator pattern.

The interface only supports forward iteration. Subclasses should use this
as their base class (so that =$it->isa("Foswiki::Iterator")= returns true),
and must implement =hasNext= and =next= per the specification below.

See Foswiki::ListIterator for an example implementation.

=cut

package Foswiki::Iterator;

use strict;
use warnings;
use Assert;

=begin TML

---++ hasNext() -> $boolean

Returns true if the iterator has more items, or false when the iterator
is exhausted.

=cut

sub hasNext { ASSERT('Pure virtual function called') if DEBUG; }

=begin TML

---++ next() -> $data

Return the next data in the iteration.

The data may be any type.

The iterator object can be customised to pre- and post-process entries from
the list before returning them. This is done by setting two fields in the
iterator object:

   * ={filter}= can be defined to be a sub that filters each entry. The entry
     will be ignored (next() will not return it) if the filter returns false.
   * ={process}= can be defined to be a sub to process each entry before it
     is returned by next. The value returned from next is the value returned
     by the process function.

=cut

sub next { ASSERT('Pure virtual function called') if DEBUG; }

=begin TML

---++ reset() -> $boolean

resets the iterator to the begining - returns false if it can't

=cut

sub reset { ASSERT('Pure virtual function called') if DEBUG; }

=begin TML

---++ ObjectMethod all() -> @list

Exhaust the iterator. Return all remaining elements in the iteration
as a list. The returned list should be considered to be immutable.

The default implementation simply runs the iterator to its end.

=cut

sub all {
    my ($this) = @_;
    my @remains;
    while ( $this->hasNext() ) {
        push( @remains, $this->next() );
    }
    return @remains;
}
