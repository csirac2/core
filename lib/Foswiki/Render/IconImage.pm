---++ StaticMethod render($session, $url [, $alt]) -> $html
Generate the output for representing an 16x16 icon image. The source of
the image is taken from =$url=. The optional =$alt= specifies an alt string.

re-written using TMPL:DEF{icon:image} in Foswiki.tmpl
%TMPL:DEF{"icon:image"}%<span class='foswikiIcon'><img src="%URL%" width="%WIDTH%" height="%HEIGHT%" alt="%ALT%" /></span>%TMPL:END%
see System.SkinTemplates:base.css for the default of .foswikiIcon img

TODO: Sven's not sure this code belongs here - its only use appears to be the ICON macro
