=begin TML

---+ package Foswiki::Logger

Object that interfaces to whatever records Foswiki log files.

This is a base class which will be subclassed by a class in the
Logger subdirectory and selected by $Foswiki::cfg{Log}{Implementation}

Note that the implementation has to provide a way for the log to be replayed.
Unfortunately this means that the simpler CPAN loggers are not suitable.

=cut

sub new {
    return bless({}, shift);
}

=begin TML

---++ ObjectMethod log($level, @fields)

Adds a log message to a log.

   * =$level= - level of the event - one of =debug=, =info=,
     =warning=, =error=, =critical=, =alert=, =emergency=.
   * =@fields= - an arbitrary list of fields to output to the log.
     These fields are recoverable when the log is enumerated using the
     =eachEventSince= method.

The levels are chosen to be compatible with Log::Dispatch.

=cut

# Default behaviour is a NOP
sub log {
}

=begin TML

---++ ObjectMethod eachEventSince($time, $level) -> $iterator
   * =$time= - a time in the past
   * =$level= - log level to return events for.

Get an iterator over the list of all the events at the given level
between =$time= and now.

Events are returned in *oldest-first* order.

Each event is returned as a reference to an array. The first element
of this array is always the date of the event (seconds since the epoch).
Subsequent elements are the fields passed to =log=.

Note that a log implementation may choose to collapse several log levels
into a single log. In this case, all messages in the same set as the
requested level will be returned if any of the collapsed levels is selected.

=cut

# Default behaviour is an empty iteration
sub eachEventSince {
    return new Foswiki::ListIterator([]);
}
