Base class of operators recognised by the Foswiki::Infix::Parser. Predefined fields
in this object used by Foswiki::Infix::Parser are:
   * =name= - operator string.
   * =prec= - operator precedence, positive non-zero integer.
     Larger number => higher precedence.
   * =arity= - set to 1 if this operator is unary, 2 for binary. Arity 0
     is legal, should you ever need it.
   * =close= - used with bracket operators. =name= should be the open
     bracket string, and =close= the close bracket. The existance of =close=
     marks this as a bracket operator.
   * =casematters== - indicates that the parser should check case in the
     operator name (i.e. treat 'AND' and 'and' as different).
     By default operators are case insensitive. *Note* that operator
     names must be caselessly unique i.e. you can't define 'AND' and 'and'
     as different operators in the same parser. Does not affect the
     interpretation of non-operator terminals (names).
   * =canfold= - means that adjacent operators of the same name can be
     folded together i.e. the operands of the second operator can be added
     to the parameter list of the first. This is mainly used for comma lists.
Other fields in the object can be used for other purposes. However field
names in the hash starting with =InfixParser_= are reserved for use
by the parser.
