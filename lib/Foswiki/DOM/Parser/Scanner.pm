---+ package Foswiki::DOM::Parser::Scanner

Foswiki::DOM::Parser::Scanner parsers are multi-pass things which treat the
=$input= as a one-dimensional landscape in which to mark various regions with
syntax. During this process, =$input= may be modified - for example, to expand
a %MACRO (replacing its occurence with its result) or to exclude some <verbatim>
content from being processed (by zeroing/null'ing it out).
