=begin TML

---+ UNPUBLISHED package Foswiki::Prefs::Web

This class is a simple wrapper around Foswiki::Prefs::Stack. Since Webs has an
hierarchical structure it's needed only one stack to deal with preferences from
Web and Web/Subweb and Web/Subweb/Subsubweb. This class has a reference to a
stack and the level where the web is.

This class is used by Foswiki::Prefs to pass web preferences to Foswiki::Meta
and should not be used for anything else.

=cut

package Foswiki::Prefs::Web;
use strict;

=begin TML

---++ ClassMethod new( $session )

Creates a new WebPrefs object. 

=cut

sub new {
    my $proto = shift;
    my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;
    my ( $stack, $level ) = @_;
    my $this = {
        stack => $stack,
        level => $level,
    };
    return bless $this, $class;
}

=begin TML

---++ ObjectMethod finish()

Break circular references.

=cut

# Note to developers; please undef *all* fields in the object explicitly,
# whether they are references or not. That way this method is "golden
# documentation" of the live fields in the object.
sub finish {
    my $this = shift;
    $this->{stack}->finish() if $this->{stack};
    undef $this->{stack};
    undef $this->{level};
}

=begin TML

---++ ObjectMethod isInTopOfStack() -> $boolean

Returns true if this web is the hihger of the underlying stack object.

=cut

sub isInTopOfStack {
    my $this = shift;
    return $this->{level} == $this->{stack}->size() - 1;
}

=begin TML

---++ ObjectMethod stack() -> $stack

Read-only accessor to the underlying stack object.

=cut

sub stack {
    return $_[0]->{stack};
}

=begin TML

---++ ObjectMethod cloneStack($level) -> $stack

This method clone the underlying stack object, to the given $level. See
Foswiki::Prefs::Stack::clone documentation.

This method exists because WebPrefs objects are used by Foswiki::Prefs instead
of bar Foswiki::Prefs::Stack and this operation is needed.

=cut

sub cloneStack {
    my ( $this, $level ) = @_;
    return $this->{stack}->clone($level);
}

=begin TML

---++ ObjectMethod get($pref) -> $value

Returns the $value of the given $pref.

=cut

sub get {
    my ( $this, $key ) = @_;
    $this->{stack}->getPreference( $key, $this->{level} );
}
