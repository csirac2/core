---+ package Foswiki::Store

This class is a pure virtual base class that specifies the interface
between the actual store implementation and the rest of the Foswiki
system.

Subclasses of this class (known as "store implementations") are
responsible for checking for topic existance, access permissions, and
all the other general admin tasks required of a store.

This class knows *nothing* about how the data is actually _stored_ -
that knowledge is entirely encapsulated in the implementation.

The general contract for methods in the class requires that errors
are signalled using exceptions. Foswiki::AccessControlException is
used for access control exceptions, and Error::Simple for all other
types of error.

Reference implementations of this base class are =Foswiki::Store::RcsWrap=
and =Foswiki::Store::RcsLite= (these are both implemented in terms of
VC::Store, which is an abstract implementation of a store based on a
version control system).

Methods of this class and all subclasses should *only* be called from
=Foswiki= and =Foswiki::Meta=. All other system components must delegate
store interactions via =Foswiki::Meta=.

For readers who are familiar with Foswiki version 1.0.0, this class
_describes_ the interface to the old =Foswiki::Store= without actually
_implementing_ it.

Note that most methods are passed a Foswiki::Meta object. This pattern is
employed to reinforce the encapsulation of a "path" in a meta object, and
also to allow the store to modify META fields in the object, something it
would be unable to do if passed $web, $topic.

Version numbers are required to be positive, non-zero integers. When
passing in version numbers to the methods of a store implementation, 0, 
undef and '' are treated as referring to the *latest* (most recent)
revision of the object. Version numbers are required to increase (later
version numbers are greater than earlier) but are *not* required to be
sequential.

Reads the given version of a topic, and populates the $topicObject.
If the =$version= is undef, then reads the most recent version. 

Returns the version identifier of the topic that was actually read. If
the topic does not exist in the store, or $version refers to a version
that does not exist, then $rev is undef. $isLatest should be set to
perl true if the version loaded (or not loaded) is the latest available
version.

Performs a type test on the given attachment file.
    * =$attachment= - name of the attachment to test e.g =lolcat.gif=
    * =$test= - the test to perform e.g. ='r'=

The return value is the value that would be returned by the standard
perl file operations, as indicated by $type

    * r File is readable by current user (tests Foswiki permissions)
    * w File is writable by current user (tests Foswiki permissions)
    * e File exists.
    * z File has zero size.
    * s File has nonzero size (returns size).
    * T File is an ASCII text file (heuristic guess).
    * B File is a "binary" file (opposite of T).
    * M Last modification time (epoch seconds).
    * A Last access time (epoch seconds).

Note that all these types should behave as the equivalent standard perl
operator behaves, except M and A which are independent of the script start
time (see perldoc -f -X for more information)

Other standard Perl file tests may also be supported on some store
implementations, but cannot be relied on.

Errors will be signalled by an Error::Simple exception.

Opens a stream onto the attachment. This method is primarily to
support virtual file systems, and as such access controls are *not*
checked, plugin handlers are *not* called, and it does *not* update the
meta-data in the topicObject.

=$mode= can be '&lt;', '&gt;' or '&gt;&gt;' for read, write, and append
respectively. %

=%opts= can take different settings depending on =$mode=.
   * =$mode='&lt;'=
      * =version= - revision of the object to open e.g. =version => 6=
   * =$mode='&gt;'= or ='&gt;&gt;'

   * =$topicObject= - Foswiki::Meta for the topic
   * =$attachment= - name of an attachment (optional)
Get an iterator over the list of revisions of the object. The iterator returns
the revision identifiers (which will usually be numbers) starting with the most recent revision.

computed over the embedded store form.

Return reference to an array of differences
   * =$topicObject= - topic, first revision loaded
   * =$rev2= - second revision
   * =$contextLines= - number of lines of context required

Each difference is of the form [ $type, $right, $left ] where

Get revision info of a topic or attachment.
   * =$topicObject= Topic object, required
   * =$rev= revision number. If 0, undef, or out-of-range, will get info
     about the most recent revision.
   * =$attachment= (optional) attachment filename; undef for a topic
Return %info with at least:
| date | in epochSec |
| user | user *object* |
| version | the revision number |
| comment | comment in the VC system, may or may not be the same as the comment in embedded meta-data |

---++ ObjectMethod saveTopic( $topicObject, $cUID, $options  ) -> $integer

Save a topic or attachment _without_ invoking plugin handlers.
   * =$topicObject= - Foswiki::Meta for the topic
   * =$cUID= - cUID of user doing the saving
   * =$options= - Ref to hash of options
=$options= may include:
   * =forcenewrevision= - force a new revision even if one isn't needed
   * =forcedate= - force the revision date to be this (epoch secs)
   * =minor= - True if this is a minor change (used in log)
   * =author= - cUID of author of the change

Returns the new revision identifier.

=begin TML

---++ ObjectMethod repRev( $topicObject, $cUID, %options ) -> $rev
   * =$topicObject= - Foswiki::Meta topic object
Replace last (top) revision of a topic with different content. The different
content is taken from the content currently loaded in $topicObject.

Parameters and return value as saveTopic, except
   * =%options= - as for saveTopic, with the extra options:
      * =forcedate= - if we want to force the deposited revision
        to look as much like the revision specified in =$rev= as possible by
        reusing the original checkin date.
      * =operation= - set to the name of the operation performing the save.
        This is used only in the log, and is normally =cmd= or =save=. It
        defaults to =save=.

Used to try to avoid the deposition of 'unecessary' revisions, for example
where a user quickly goes back and fixes a spelling error.

Also provided as a means for administrators to rewrite history (forcedate).

It is up to the store implementation if this is different
to a normal save or not.

Returns the id of the latest revision.

Implementation must invoke 'update' on event listeners.

   * =$topicObject= - Foswiki::Meta topic object
   * =$cUID= - cUID of user doing the deleting

Parameters and return value as saveTopic.

Provided as a means for administrators to rewrite history.

Delete last entry in repository, restoring the previous
revision.

It is up to the store implementation whether this actually
does delete a revision or not; some implementations will
simply promote the previous revision up to the head.

Implementation must invoke 'update' on event listeners.

=begin TML

---++ ObjectMethod atomicUnlock( $topicObject )

   * =$topicObject= - Foswiki::Meta topic object
Release the topic lock on the given topic. A topic lock will cause other
processes that also try to claim a lock to block. It is important to
release a topic lock after a guard section is complete. This should
normally be done in a 'finally' block. See man Error for more info.

Topic locks are used to make store operations atomic. They are
_note_ the locks used when a topic is edited; those are Leases
(see =getLease=)

---++ ObjectMethod eachChange( $web, $time ) -> $iterator

Get an iterator over the list of all the changes in the given web between
=$time= and now. $time is a time in seconds since 1st Jan 1970, and is not
guaranteed to return any changes that occurred before (now -
{Store}{RememberChangesFor}). Changes are returned in most-recent-first
order.

=begin TML

---++ ObjectMethod eachAttachment( $topicObject ) -> \$iterator

Return an iterator over the list of attachments stored for the given
topic. This will get a list of the attachments actually stored for the
topic, which may be a longer list than the list that comes from the
topic meta-data, which only lists the attachments that are normally
visible to the user.

the iterator iterates over attachment names.

---++ ObjectMethod eachWeb($webObject, $all ) -> $iterator

Return an iterator over each subweb. If $all is set, will return a list of all
web names *under* $web. The iterator returns web pathnames relative to $web.

The list of web names is sorted alphabetically by full path name e.g.
   * AWeb
   * AWeb/SubWeb

Search for data in the store (not web based).
   * =$query= either a =Foswiki::Search::Node= or a =Foswiki::Query::Node=.
   * =$inputTopicSet= is a reference to an iterator containing a list
     of topic in this web, if set to undef, the search/query algo will
     create a new iterator using eachTopic() 
     and the topic and excludetopics options

Returns a =Foswiki::Search::InfoCache= iterator

This will become a 'query engine' factory that will allow us to plug in
different query 'types' (Sven has code for 'tag' and 'attachment' waiting

=begin TML

---++ ObjectMethod getLease( $topicObject ) -> $lease

   * =$topicObject= - topic

If there is an lease on the topic, return the lease, otherwise undef.
A lease is a block of meta-information about a topic that can be
recovered (this is a hash containing =user=, =taken= and =expires=).
Leases are taken out when a topic is edited. Only one lease
can be active on a topic at a time. Leases are used to warn if
another user is already editing a topic.
