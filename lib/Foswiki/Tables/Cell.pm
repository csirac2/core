=begin TML

---+ package Foswiki::Tables::Cell

Abstract model of a table cell, suitable for use with the tables parser.

# Default format if no other format is defined for a cell
my $defCol ||= { type => 'text', size => 20, values => [] };

=begin TML

---++ ClassMethod new($row, $precruft, $text, $postcruft, $isHeader) -> $cell
Construct a new table cell.
   * =$row= - the row the cell belongs to (Foswiki::Tables::Row or subclass)
   * =$precruft= - whatever precedes the text inside the cell (spaces)
   * =$text= - the text stored in the cell
   * =$postcruft= - whatever follows the text inside the cell (spaces)
   * =$isHeader= - true if this is a header cell (content delimited by **)

Note that =$postcruft= and =$precruft= should *not* include the * indicating a header.

    my ( $class, $row, $precruft, $text, $postcruft, $ish ) = @_;

=begin TML

---++ ObjectMethod number([$set]) -> $number

Setter/getter for the row number. The row number uniquely identifies the row
within the context of a table. The row number is undef until it is set by
some external agency (e.g. the table)

=cut

sub number {
    my ( $this, $number ) = @_;

=begin TML

---++ ObjectMethod finish()
Clean up for disposal

=cut

    my $this = shift;
    $this->{row} = undef;
}

=begin TML

---++ ObjectMethod stringify()
Generate a TML representation of the row

=cut

    my $this = shift;

    # Jeff Crawford, Item5043:
    # replace linefeeds with breaks to support multiline textareas
    my $text = $this->{text};

    # Remove tactical spaces

    my $h = $this->{isHeader} ? '*' : '';
    return "$this->{precruft}$h$text$h$this->{postcruft}";
}

=begin TML

---++ ObjectMethod getID() -> $id
Generate a unique string ID that uniquely identifies this cell within a topic.

=cut

sub getID {
    my $this = shift;
    return $this->{row}->getID() . '_'
      . ( defined $this->{number} ? $this->{number} : '' );
