=begin TML

---+ package Foswiki::Parsers::Table

Re-usable sequential access event-based parser for TML tables.

A sequential access event-based parser works by parsing content
and calling back to "event listeners" when syntactic constructs
are recognised.

=begin TML

---++ StaticMethod parse( $text, \&dispatch )

   * $text - text to parse
   * \&dispatch($event_name, ...) - event dispatcher (function)

This is a sequential event-based parser. As each line in the text is read,
it is analysed and if it meets the criteria for an event, it is fired.

In keeping with the line-oriented nature of TML, the parser works on
a line-by-line basis. =&lt;verbatim&gt;= and =&lt;literal&gt;= blocks are
respected.

Events are fired by a call to $dispatch( ... ). The following events are
fired:

---+++ =open_table($line)=
Opens a new table with the given line. Note that this same line will be passed
to new_row as well.

---+++ =close_table()=
Close the currently open table.

---+++ =line($line)=
Called for any line that is not part of a table and is not caught by
an =early_line= event handler returning true.

---+++ =open_tr($before)=
Called on each row in an open table (including the header and footer rows)
   * =$before= - leading content (spaces and |)

---+++ =th($pre, $data, $post)=
Called to create a table header cell.
   * =$pre= - preamble (spaces)
   * =$data= - real content
   * =$post= - postamble (spaces)

---+++ =td($pre, $data, $post)=
Called to create a table cell.
   * =$pre= - preamble (spaces)
   * =$data= - real content
   * =$post= - postamble (spaces)

---+++ =close_tr($after)=
Called to close an open table row.
   * =$after= - trailing content (| and spaces)

An additional event is provided for those seeking to perform special
processing of certain lines, including rewriting them.

---+++ =early_line($line) -> $integer=
Mainly provided for handling lines other than TML content that may
interact with tables during a static parse e.g. special macros such
as %EDITTABLE.
The first result should be 0 to continue normal processing of the line,
1 to skip further processing of this line.

Note that =early_line= operates on the internal representation of the
line in the parser. Certain constructs, such as verbatim blocks, are
specially marked in this content. =early_line= can be used to rewrite
the line in place, but only with *great care*. Caveat emptor.

The =early_line= fired for all lines that may be part of
a table (i.e. not verbatim or literal lines).
