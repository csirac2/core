Private subclass of Foswiki::Iterator that
   * Is passed a array reference of a list of iterator arrays.
   * Scans across the list of iterators using snoopNext to find the iterator with the lowest timestamp
   * returns true to hasNext if any iterator has any records available.
   * returns the record with the lowest timestamp to the next() request.
