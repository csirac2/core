---+ Wiki Administrator User

The %TOPIC% allows you to login without needing to register a user,
or to temporarily login as %TOPIC% using the password set in configure, and then log back out to the same User and Group as before.

If your system is configured using a !UserMapper that permits group maintenance, (!TopicUserMapping for example) it is recommended to include the %SYSTEMWEB%.AdminToggle topic to obtain admin rights.

%STARTSECTION{"sudo_login"}%
---+++ How to login as %TOPIC%
   * Login as the internal Wiki administrator:
      * %ADMINLOGIN%
   * Logout from Administrator:
      * click the [[%LOGOUTURL%][Logout link]]

*%X% NOTE:* If you lock yourself out of <nop>AdminUser during setup activities or have forgotten the configure password,
you can unset the configure password by editing the =lib/LocalSite.cfg= file and deleting the line that starts
with =Foswiki::cfg{Password}= and then set it again by saving your settings in =configure=.
%ENDSECTION{"sudo_login"}%

---+++ Prerequisites
   * =Security Setup : Sessions : {UserClientSession}= needs to be enabled in configure
   * a configure password (otherwise the Admin login is automatically disabled.)
   * If your Foswiki is configured to use !ApacheLoginManager, you will need to log in as a valid user first.
   
<blockquote class="foswikiAlert">
%X% Do not add =AdminUser= to your =.htpasswd= file or other authentication system.  You should only access the =AdminUser= by logging in
with the special user and password set in the first save in the =bin/configure= script. Use the =sudo= feature, or log in directly with
Template Login. Logging in with the =AdminUser= !WikiName through the normal authentication process will not acquire admin rights.
