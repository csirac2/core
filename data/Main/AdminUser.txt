---+ Wiki Administrator User

The %TOPIC% allows you to login without needing to register a user,
or to temporarily login as %TOPIC% using the password set in configure, and then log back out to the same User and Group as before.

This means it is no longer necessary to add yourself to the AdminGroup, and you will be able to quickly
change to Admin User (and back to your user) only when you need to.

%STARTSECTION{"sudo_login"}%
---+++ How to login as %TOPIC%
   * Login as the internal Wiki administrator:
      * %ADMINLOGIN%
   * Logout from Administrator:
      * click the [[%LOGOUTURL%][Logout link]]

*%X% NOTE:* If you lock yourself out of <nop>AdminUser during setup activities or have forgotten the configure password,
you can unset the configure password by editing the =lib/LocalSite.cfg= file and deleting the line that starts
with =Foswiki::cfg{Password}= and then set it again by saving your settings in =configure=.
%ENDSECTION{"sudo_login"}%

---+++ Prerequisites
   * =Security Setup : Sessions : {UserClientSession}= needs to be enabled in configure
   * a configure password (otherwise the Admin login is automatically disabled.)
   * If your Foswiki is configured to use !ApacheLoginManager, you will need to log in as a valid user first.
   
<blockquote class="foswikiAlert">
%X% Do not add =AdminUser= to your =.htpasswd= file or other authentication system.  You should only access the =AdminUser= by logging in
with the special user and password set in the first save in the =bin/configure= script. Use the =sudo= feature, or log in directly with
Template Login. Logging in with the =AdminUser= !WikiName through the normal authentication process will not acquire admin rights.
