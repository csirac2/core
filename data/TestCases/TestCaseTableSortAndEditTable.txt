---+ Tables with initsort and EDITTABLE

Description: Manual test of the combinations of TABLE, EDITTABLE, and CALC macros and manual test of adding rows with TABLE and EDITTABLE containing other macros

---++ Test Steps

The following is a typical time schedule shown in a table.

It is by default sorted by the 2nd column (the planned date).

   * Check that the top table has column widths 320, 130, 130, 130 when viewed 
   * Edit the first table using !EditTablePlugin feature.
      * Check that the date fields work
      * Check that the first column is shown in alphabetical order in the table you are editing
      * Check that the other table is still sorted by date in the 2nd column.
      * Edit one of the dates in the 3rd or 4th column
   * Save the table
      * Check that the table is still sorted by the 2nd column
      * Check that the edits you did are there
   * Edit the 2nd table
      * Check that the first table is sorted by planned date
      * Check that the current edited table is not sorted (first column in alphabetical order)
      * Add a new row
      * Enter some data - you must put a date in the 2nd column
      * Move the row up some row positions
      * Save
   * Check that the 2nd table is sorted by planned date
   * Check in raw view that the 2nd table is still in the original order with first column by alphabetical order, except the row you inserted and moved up
   * Check that the TABLE and EDITTABLE tags are still there and are intact
