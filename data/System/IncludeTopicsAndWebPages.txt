---+!! Include Topics and Web Pages Using =%<nop>INCLUDE{...}%= Macro

Use the =%<nop>INCLUDE{...}%= macro to embed the content of another topic or web page inside a topic. The whole content or only parts of a page can be included. If needed, set a proxy server with the {PROXY}{HOST} and {PROXY}{PORT} settings in [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure]].

%TOC%

---++ Syntax Example

=%<nop>INCLUDE{ "page" pattern="reg-exp" rev="2" warn="off" section="clients" PARAMETER1="value" PARAMETER2="Some value"}%=

The =pattern= parameter is optional and allows you to extract some parts of a web page. Specify a %SYSTEMWEB%.RegularExpression that scans from start (='^'=) to end and contains the text you want to keep in parenthesis, e.g., =pattern="^.*?(from here.*?to here).*"=. You need to make sure that the integrity of a web page is not compromised; for example, if you include a table, make sure to include everything including the table end tag.

The example parameters PARAMETER1 and PARAMETER2 will be defined as macros within the scope of the included topic. The example parameters shown will result in %PARAMETER1% and %PARAMETER2% being defined within the included topic.

VarINCLUDE explains the other parameters.

*Note:* All text of a topic is included unless it contains a =%<nop>STARTINCLUDE%= and =%<nop>STOPINCLUDE%=, or you specify a =section= parameter and/or a =pattern= parameter. A pattern will only search between =%<nop>STARTINCLUDE%= and =%<nop>STOPINCLUDE%=.

---++ Usage Examples

---+++ 1. Display regression test results
<pre>
  &lt;pre&gt;
  %<nop>INCLUDE{"http://domain/~qa/v1.1/REDTest.log.txt"}%
  &lt;/pre&gt;
</pre>

---+++ 2. Display foswiki.org's frequently asked questions

   * You type:
<pre>
  %<nop>INCLUDE{"http://foswiki.org/Support/FrequentlyAskedQuestion?skin=text"}%
</pre>

   * You get:
%INCLUDE{"http://foswiki.org/Support/FrequentlyAskedQuestion?skin=text"}%

*Note:* Including URLs is disabled by default as it presents a security risk. It may be enabled via [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure]]. _Only enable this if you understand the risk_.

---+++ 3. Include a topic

   * You type:
<pre>
  %<nop>INCLUDE{%<nop>SYSTEMWEB%.TipsOfTheDayInclude}%
</pre>

   * You get:
%INCLUDE{%SYSTEMWEB%.TipsOfTheDayInclude}%

---+++ 4. Include a topic !MyTopic with two parameters

You include the topic with this line
<verbatim>
  %INCLUDE{ "MyTopic" BETTER="apples" WORSE="Oranges"}%
</verbatim>

An example of a very simple !MyTopic could contain

<verbatim>
   * I like %BETTER% better than %WORSE%.
</verbatim> 

The result would be

   * I like apples better than oranges.
