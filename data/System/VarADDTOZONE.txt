#VarADDTOZONE
---+++ ADDTOZONE

<verbatim class="tml">
%ADDTOZONE{
  "zone"
  ...
}%
</verbatim>

_Zones_ are specific places in the output HTML that are marked in the source templates using the [[VarRENDERZONE][RENDERZONE]] macro. Zones are used to collect various materials together, such as Javascript and CSS, that must be included in the output HTML in a specific order, and in a specific place. By default, skins define two zones, =head= and =body= which are in the HEAD tag and at the end of the BODY tag respectively.

Each =ADDTOZONE= call can be identified by a _unique identifier_, and you can state dependencies on other identifiers. In this way you can constraint the order in which the text added by each call is expanded in the output.

Parameters:
   * ="zone"= optional, comma-separated list of the names of zones that
   the content should be added to. Defaults to =head=.
   * =tag="id"= optional, =unique identifier= for this =ADDTOZONE= call, to be used in =requires= in other =ADDTOZONE= calls,
   * =requires="..."= comma-separated list of =unique identifiers= for other =ADDTOZONE= calls that must be expanded before the text from this call.
   * =text="..."= optional, text to be added to the named zone, mutually exclusive with =topic=
   * =topic="..."= optional, full qualified web-topic name that contains the text to be added, mutually exclusive with =text=
   * =section="..."= optional, section of the =topic= to be added,
     defaults to the default section between STARTINCLUDE and
     STOPINCLUDE

Note that using =topic= and =section= is actually a short form of 
<verbatim class="tml">
%ADDTOZONE{
   "myzone"
   text="$percntINCLUDE{\"topic\" section=\"section\" warn=\"off\"}$percnt"
}%
</verbatim>
