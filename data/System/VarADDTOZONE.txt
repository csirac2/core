#VarADDTOZONE
---+++ ADDTOZONE

<verbatim class="tml">
%ADDTOZONE{
  "zone"
  ...
}%
</verbatim>

_Zones_ are specific places in the output HTML that are marked by calls to the [[VarRENDERZONE][RENDERZONE]] macro. Zones are used to collect various content together, such as Javascript and CSS, that must be included in the output HTML in a specific order, and in a specific place.

You may create as many zones in addition to the standard [[#HeadAndScript][ =head= and =script= ]] zones as you like. Interesting use cases in wiki applications:
   * Create a =sidebar= zone to add widgets,
   * Create a =toolbar= zone to add buttons icons

[[%TOPIC%][ADDTOZONE]] adds content identified with the =id= parameter to =zone=, which will later be expanded with [[VarRENDERZONE][RENDERZONE]]. =id= identifiers are unique within the zone that they are added to. An [[%TOPIC%][ADDTOZONE]] call may ensure that its content appears _after_ the content of some other [[%TOPIC%][ADDTOZONE]] calls by specifying their =ids= in the =requires= parameter. =requires= may only list =ids= within the specified =zone=, except for the special case of =head= and =script= zones when [[%SCRIPTURL{configure}%#HTMLPageLayout$Tuning][{MergeHeadAndScriptZones}]] is set ([[#HeadAndScript][read more]]).

*Parameters:*
   * ="zone"= optional, comma-separated list of the names of zones that the content should be added to. Defaults to =head=.
   * =id= optional, =identifier= for the text being added with the =ADDTOZONE= call, to be used in the =requires= parameter of other =ADDTOZONE= calls.
      * %H% Multiple =ADDTOZONE= calls with the same =id= parameter will simply overwrite the earlier =ADDTOZONE= call.
   * =requires="..."= optional, comma separated string of =ids= of text within this =zone= that this content should follow when the zone is rendered.
   * =text="..."= optional, text to be added to the named zone, mutually exclusive with =topic=.
   * =topic="..."= optional, full qualified =web.topic= name that contains the text to be added, mutually exclusive with =text=.
   * =section="..."= optional, section of the =topic= to be added,
     defaults to the default section between [[VarSTARTINCLUDE][STARTINCLUDE]] and [[VarSTOPINCLUDE][STOPINCLUDE]].<br/>
      * %H% Using =topic= and =section= is actually a short form of 
      <verbatim class="tml">
%ADDTOZONE{
   "myzone"
   text="$percentINCLUDE{\"topic\" section=\"section\" warn=\"off\"}$percent"
}%</verbatim>

__Note:__ Foswiki uses the =requires= parameter to resolve the _ordering_ of dependencies within a zone. It does *not* work across zones. If you have an id in =requires= that cannot be resolved during sorting, then =RENDERZONE= will generate an HTML comment to mark the problem.

#HeadAndScript
---++++ How to use the =head= and =script= zones

Web browsers generally process the HTML on a page from top to bottom. When a
=&lt;script&gt;= tag is encountered with a URL to some Javascript file,
processing of the page will stop while the file is fetched and executed before
continuing. When a page makes heavy use of Javascript you can get a "blank
screen" effect in the browser while each script is downloaded. To avoid this
effect, =&lt;script&gt;= tags can be moved to the end of the HTML page, so that
the user may view the page content while scripts are being loaded.

Foswiki makes this move possible by providing the =head= and =script= zones.
These are _automatic_ zones - they do not require a corresponding =RENDERZONE=.
<blockquote class="foswikiHelp">%I% Rendering the =script= zone at the end of
the HTML body requires [[SkinTemplates][skin template]] customisation with
[[VarRENDERZONE][%<nop>RENDERZONE{"script"}%]]</blockquote>

Notionally the =head= and =script= zones correspond to a point just before the
HTML =&lt;/HEAD&gt;= tag. Normally you should add CSS (and other HTML
=&lt;HEAD&gt;= content, such as =&lt;META&gt;=) to the =head= zone, and
Javascript =&lt;script&gt;= markup to the =script= zone. The setting
[[%SCRIPTURL{configure}%#HTMLPageLayout$Tuning][{MergeHeadAndScriptZones}]]
in Configure controls what happens when [[VarRENDERZONE][RENDERZONE]] is called.

Normally, dependencies between the individual [[VarADDTOZONE][ADDTOZONE]]
statements are resolved *within each zone*. However, if
[[%SCRIPTURL{configure}%#HTMLPageLayout$Tuning][{MergeHeadAndScriptZones}]] is
enabled, then =head= content which =requires= an =id= that only exists in
=script= (and vice-versa) will be re-ordered to satisfy any dependency.

<blockquote class="foswikiHelp">%X% ={MergeHeadAndScriptZones}= is provided to
maintain compatibility with legacy extensions that use
[[VarADDTOHEAD][ADDTOHEAD]] to add =&lt;script&gt;= markup and require content
that is now in the =script= zone. ={MergeHeadAndScriptZones}= will be removed
from a future version of Foswiki.</blockquote>

---+++++ Workign with ={MergeHeadAndScriptZones}= disabled (default)
In this mode, the =head= and =script= zones are treated separately.

---+++++ Working with ={MergeHeadAndScriptZones}= enabled
In this mode, the =head= and =script= zones are separate when adding to them,
but may be treated as merged when you call [[VarRENDERZONE][RENDERZONE]] if
there are any dependencies specified that only exist in the opposite zone. This
allows an =ADDTOZONE{"head"...}= to to successfully require an =id= that has
been added to =script=.

Only add content to the =script= zone _that is also legal in the =&lt;HEAD&gt;=._

---++++ Example: Adding to a zone with missing dependencies
You must ensure that no =head= content (and no inline Javascript) depends on =script= content, or vice-versa. Any such dependency will be _ignored_. However, the HTML comment decoration which normally appears after each id's content in the rendered HTML will contain a small informative text to aid debugging<br/> *Example* <br/>
<verbatim class="tml">%ADDTOZONE{
  "head"
  text="
  <script type='text/javascript'>
    alert('test');
  </script>"
  requires="some-id-that-exists-in-script"
  id="MY::TEST"
}%</verbatim><br/> *Result*
  <verbatim class="html">
<script type='text/javascript'>
  alert('test');
</script>
<!-- MY::TEST: requires= missing ids: some-id-that-exists-in-script --></verbatim>
   On the other hand, as explained earlier - when [[%SCRIPTURL{configure}%#HTMLPageLayout$Tuning][{MergeHeadAndScriptZones}]] is enabled - Foswiki is able resolve such dependencies successfully.

Note that if you *do* have an explicit call to =%<nop>RENDERZONE{"head"}%= in
your templates then the content expanded at that point will be the same content
as would be inserted before the =&lt;/HEAD&gt;=.

#ExampleAddingJS
---++++ Example: Adding Javascript to a page
   * Make sure that all inline Javascript code in the topic (if it is allowed)
     is added to the page using =%<nop>ADDTOZONE{"script"...requires="library-id"}%=
     with the appropriate library-id to guarantee a correct load order. For example, jQuery code should be added as follows:
     <verbatim class="js">
%JQREQUIRE{"shake"}%%ADDTOZONE{
   "script"
   id="MyApp::ShakePart"
   text="
   <script type='text/javascript'>
      jQuery('#something').shake(3, 10, 180);
   </script>"
   requires="JQUERYPLUGIN::SHAKE"
}%</verbatim> where "MyApp::ShakePart" is a unique =id= to identify the text added to =script=; and =JQUERYPLUGIN::SHAKE= signifies that the content added with that identifier should appear beforehand.
