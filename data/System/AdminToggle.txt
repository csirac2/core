---+ Group Member Toggle

This topic implements a button that will turn Admin status on or off for the
current user (!%WIKINAME%), by adding or removing the user from the
!AdminGroup.  This new function is recommended to replace =sudo= login when
possible.  It provides better security and allows changes to be tracked to the
user making the change instead of the anonymous !AdminUser.

%T% This is actually a generic capability.  Any group membership can be toggled using this function.

<blockquote class="foswikiHelp"> 
  %T% Note: This feature is only usable if your User Mapper allows group membership to be modified from the Wiki.
