---++ Foswiki - The Free and Open Source Wiki

Foswiki is an enterprise collaboration and information sharing tool targeted for professional use in many types of organizations: from small businesses to multi-nationals, from one-product open source groups, to worldwide research networks.

Foswiki is a wiki: fundamentally, a website with editable web pages. It looks like a normal web site but it encourages contributions, edits, updates, questions, and answers from its users. It's a powerful way of enabling a community to communicate asynchronously using intranet and public internet websites. Foswiki is simple to learn and use. It aims to provide a transparent way for you to publish and exchange your ideas with others over the web and eliminates the one-webmaster syndrome of outdated intranet content.

Foswiki is a structured wiki with tools that enable users without programming skills to build powerful yet simple applications to process information and support workflows. Developers can extend the functionality of Foswiki with plugins.

Foswiki is the old TWiki project under a new name. Restrictions on the use of the TWiki brand resulted in many of its developers continuing the project under the new Foswiki name. Foswiki is backwards compatible with all content from older TWiki installations. Foswiki 1.1 ships with a !TWikiCompatibilityPlugin installed and activated by default, thus enabling most extensions made for TWiki to work under Foswiki.

Since the start of the Foswiki project there have been several releases of TWiki, However there have been very few functionality changes, and the useful changes have all been tracked in Foswiki, so topics and wiki applications supported by TWiki should also work with Foswiki.

Foswiki is released under the GNU General Public License.

---++ What's new &mdash; highlights
***UPDATE ME***

---++ Important Changes since Foswiki 1.0.9

---+++ Testing configuration variables in %IF
Prior to 1.1, %IF could be used to test the value of any configuration variable (those defined in =configure=). This represented a security risk, so now only those variables listed in ={AccessibleCFG}= may be accessed this way. Note that ={AccessibleCFG}= also controls which variables are visible in =%SEARCH{type="query"= and the new =%QUERY= macro.

See ReleaseNotes01x00 for detailed information about changes in that release.

---+++ Notes for extension authors
---++++ Deprecated handlers
The following handlers have been deprecated (i.e. they are still available,
but should not be used in new code and will be removed in a future release,
so if you have been used them, you need to modify your code).

The =redirectCGIQueryHandler= plugin handler has been deprecated (it is
still available, but should not be used in new code and will be removed
in a future release, so if you have been used it, you need to modify your
code). This handler assumed a level of interaction with the CGI handling
process that is dangerous if misused, and severely limits the flexibility and
optimisations available to the core.

The =beforeAttachmentSaveHandler= and =afterAttachmentSaveHandler= plugin
handlers have been
deprecated in favour of the newly added =beforeUploadHandler= and
=afterUploadHandler. The new handlers operate on streams, and are
more efficient as well as more secure.

Deprecated handlers will continue to work as documented in 1.1 and for the
immediate future, but will be removed in a future release. Extension authors
are strongly recommended to implement the new handlers as soon as possible.

---++++ Deprecated Foswiki::Func functions
The =readTopicText= and =saveTopicText= functions have been deprecated. Use
=readTopic= and =saveTopic= instead. Both =readTopic= and =saveTopic= have
always been available in Foswiki (and it's predecessor) and are a lot safer.
Existing code can usually be modified to eliminate these deprecated functions
without difficulty.
 
---++++ Tainting
The Foswiki core now checks values used for web, topic and attachment names for 'taintedness' when FOSWIKI_ASSERTS are enabled. Tainted values are those that have been taken from user input (for example, from topic content or from form fields) without being validated. Such unchecked values are a large potential security hole, and the authors of plugins that manipulate topics or attachments need to check their plugins with Foswiki ASSERTs enabled. If you find a taint error, you can use the fnctions for =Foswiki::Sandbox= to validate them. For example, to validate a web name and a topic name, you would write:
<verbatim>
$validWebName = Foswiki::Sandbox::untaint(
    $webName, \&Foswiki::Sandbox::validateWebName);
$validTopicName = Foswiki::Sandbox::untaint(
    $topicName, \&Foswiki::Sandbox::validateWebName);
</verbatim>
If =$webName= is not a legal web name, then =$webName= will end up being undefined. Similarly for the topic name.

Note that values are only checked for taintedness when FOSWIKI_ASSERTS are enabled, so unless you run your Foswiki in this mode, you will never see the errors. To enable asserts, simply add the line:
<verbatim>
$ENV{FOSWIKI_ASSERTS} = 1;
</verbatim>
to your =bin/LocalLib.cfg=.
