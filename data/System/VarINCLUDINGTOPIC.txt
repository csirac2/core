#VarINCLUDINGTOPIC
---+++ INCLUDINGTOPIC -- name of topic that includes current topic
   * The name of the topic that includes the current topic - same as =%<nop>TOPIC%= in case there is no include
   * If a topic is used in a chain of =INCLUDEs=, =INCLUDINGTOPIC= is set to the topic directly INCLUDing this one, _NOT_ the topic that has been requested by the user (which is set in =BASETOPIC=)
   <blockquote class="foswikiHelp">%X% While this Macro may appear to work, unless you require the subtle difference between =INCLUDINGTOPIC= and =BASETOPIC=, you probably should use =BASETOPIC= </blockquote>
   * Syntax: =%<nop>INCLUDINGTOPIC%=
