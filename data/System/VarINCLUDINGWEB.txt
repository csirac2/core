#VarINCLUDINGWEB
---+++ INCLUDINGWEB -- web that includes current topic
   * The web name of the topic that includes the current topic - same as =%<nop>WEB%= if there is no INCLUDE.
   * If a topic is used in a chain of INCLUDEs, INCLUDINGWEB is set to the topic directly INCLUDing this one, _NOT_ the web that has been requested by the user (which is set in BASEWEB)
   * __WARNING:__ While this Macro may appear to work, unless you require the subtle difference between INCLUDINGWEB and BASEWEB, you probably should use BASEWEB.
   * Syntax: =%<nop>INCLUDINGWEB%=
