---+!! Foswiki System Requirements

Low client and server base requirements are core features that keep Foswiki widely deployable, particularly across a range of browser platforms and versions. Many extensions exist which enhance and expand Foswiki's capabilities; they may have additional requirements.

---++ Server Requirements

Foswiki is written in Perl 5, which is supported on Microsoft Windows as well as Unix and Unix-like systems (including Linux and OSX), on which it uses a number of shell commands and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/rcs.html" rel="nofollow" target="_top">RCS (Revision Control System)</a>, a GNU Free Software package. It should be able to run on any server platform that meets the following requirements.

| *Resource* | *Required Server Environment* |
| Perl | 5.8.8 or higher |
| RCS | 5.7 or higher (including GNU =diff=) <br /> Optional. Foswiki includes a pure Perl implementation of RCS (RcsLite) that can be used instead, at the cost of performance |
| GNU diff | GNU diff 2.7 or higher is required when not using the all-Perl RcsLite. <br /> Install within the PATH if not included with RCS (check version with =diff -v=) <br /> Must be the version used by RCS, to avoid problems with binary attachments - RCS may have hard-coded path to =diff= |
| Other external programs | =fgrep, egrep= |
| Cron/scheduler | &bull; Unix: =cron= <br />&bull; Windows: =cron= equivalents <!-- SMELL: Macintosh version? --> |
| Web server | Apache is well supported; for information on other servers, see Foswiki:Support.InstallingOnSpecificPlatforms. |

---++ Perl Modules

A complete list of the required and optional Perl modules can be found in =lib/DEPENDENCIES=.

Most of them will probably already be available in your installation. You can check version numbers with the =configure= script, or if you're still trying to get to that point, check from the command line like this:
<verbatim class="bash">
perl -e 'use FileHandle; print $FileHandle::VERSION."\n"'
</verbatim>

#ClientRequirements
---++ Client Requirements

The [[InstallationGuide][standard installation]] has relatively low browser requirements:

   * XHTML 1.0 Transitional compliant
   * Cookies, if persistent sessions are required
   * Javascript, for edit/save/upload functionality <blockquote class="foswikiHelp">%T% Change ={ValidationMethod}{Method}= from =strikeone= to =embedded= in [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure]] to allow non-javascript browsers to edit/save/upload</blockquote>

CSS and Javascript are used in most skins. Some skins will require more recent releases of browsers. The default skin is tested on IE 6+, Safari, Chrome and Firefox.

You can easily select a balance of browser capability versus look and feel. Try the installed skins at %SYSTEMWEB%.SkinBrowser and more at Foswiki:Extensions.SkinPackage.
