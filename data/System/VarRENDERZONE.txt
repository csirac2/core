#VarRENDERZONE
---+++ RENDERZONE

<verbatim class="tml">
%RENDERZONE{"zone" ...}%
</verbatim>
See [[VarADDTOZONE][ADDTOZONE]] for an explanation of _zones_.

Parameters:
   * ="zone"= required, name of the zone
   * =header="..."= optional, prefix format string
   * =format="..."= optional, format string for each item added to the zone, defaults to =$item=. Tokens:
      * =$id= - =id= of the [[VarADDTOZONE][ADDTOZONE]] call within the =zone= currently being rendered.
      * =$item= - text of the [[VarADDTOZONE][ADDTOZONE]] call within the =zone= currently being rendered.
      * =$zone= - the ="zone"= currently being rendered.
      * =$missing= - if the [[VarADDTOZONE][ADDTOZONE]] call being rendered required any =id= which was not found, then =$missing= is the =missingtoken= parameter; empty string otherwise.
      * =$missingids= - comma separated list of ids that were required by the [[VarADDTOZONE][ADDTOZONE]] call currently being rendered but weren't found within this =zone=.
   * =missingtoken="..."= optional, this will be the string assigned to the =$missing= format token for use in the =format= parameter. Defaults to ="$missingids"=
   * =chomp="on"= remove leading and trailing whitespace from formatted items, can be useful for pretty-printing and compression.
   * =footer="..."= optional, suffix format string
   * =separator="..."= optional, put between each item of a zone

Supports the [[FormatTokens][standard format tokens]] in the =format= and =separator= (but *not* in the =header= or =footer=).

=header= and =footer= are output irrespective of whether there is any content
in the zone or not.

=head= and =body= are _built-in_ zones - there is no corresponding =RENDERZONE=
required in the templates, they will be rendered automatically.

%ICON{"info"}% Zones are flushed when rendered; they may only be rendered once

See also [[VarADDTOZONE][ADDTOZONE]] for more information on zones.
