---+ Managing Webs

_Adding, renaming and deleting webs are all web-based operations._

%TOC%

---++ Overview

A site is divided into webs; each one represents one subject, one area of collaboration. Administrators can add/rename/delete webs.

#WebTemplate
---++ Choose Web Template

There are two methods used to create a new web.  First you can use a specially designed TemplateWeb.  This is an invisible web that begins with an underscore &quot;_&quot; character (for example =_default=).  All topics in the template web will be copied into your new web.

The second method is to use an existing web as a template web.  This may be useful if you already have a web that you would like to use as a starting point.  Only topics that have names beginning with *Web...* (like "%HOMETOPIC%", "%NOTIFYTOPIC%", etc.) are copied.

In either case you will want to be sure to verify that your new web has all the custom modifications that you desire. Any [[macros]] defined in the form below will automatically be set in the !WebPreferences of the new web.

#CreateNewWeb
---++ Adding a New Web
New webs can be created using the WebCreateNewWeb [[AdminToolsCategory][AdminTool]].
You must have =ROOTCHANGE= access to create a top-level web (one with no parent)
Only the person who created it has permission to change the <nop>%WEBPREFSTOPIC% in the new web.

---++ Hierarchical Webs

You can only create hierarchical webs (webs within webs) if the ={EnableHierarchicalWebs}= setting in [[%SCRIPTURLPATH{"configure"}%][configure]] is enabled. Hierarchical webs are currently %IF{"{EnableHierarchicalWebs}" then="enabled." else="disabled. Without this setting, Foswiki will only allow a single level of hierarchy. With it, you can use multiple levels, like a directory tree, i.e. webs within webs."}%

*%T% Note:* You might not need hierarchical webs. Foswiki topics already have a parent/child relationship within a web, which is shown in the breadcrumb. Try to keep the number of webs to a minimum in order to keep search and cross-referencing simple.

You can create hierarchical webs via the _Adding a New Web_ form above, by using a slash- or dot-separated path name which is based on an existing web name in the _Name of new web:_ field.

*Example:*

To create a subweb named =Bar= inside a web named =Foo=, use =Foo/Bar= or =Foo.Bar= as the new web name in the form above.

---+++ Subweb Preferences are Inherited

The [[preference settings]] of a subweb are inherited from the parent web and overridden locally.  Preferences are ultimately inherited from the [[%SYSTEMWEB%.DefaultPreferences]] topic.

*Example Preference Inheritance for =Sandbox/TestWeb/SubWeb.SubWebTopic= topic:*

   1 =%SYSTEMWEB%.DefaultPreferences= default settings
   1 =%USERSWEB%.SitePreferences= site-wide settings inherits from and overrides settings in =%SYSTEMWEB%.DefaultPreferences=
   1 =Sandbox.%WEBPREFSTOPIC%= inherits from and overrides settings in =%USERSWEB%.SitePreferences=
   1 =Sandbox/TestWeb.%WEBPREFSTOPIC%= inherits from and overrides settings in =Sandbox.%WEBPREFSTOPIC%=
   1 =Sandbox/TestWeb/SubWeb.%WEBPREFSTOPIC%= inherits from and overrides settings in =Sandbox/TestWeb.%WEBPREFSTOPIC%= 
   1 =Sandbox/TestWeb/SubWeb.SubWebTopic= inherits from and overrides settings in =Sandbox/TestWeb/SubWeb.%WEBPREFSTOPIC%= 

---+++ Navigation

The Pattern skin (default) indicates Subwebs by indenting them in the sidebar relative to their level in the hierarchy.

#RenameWeb
---++ Renaming or Deleting a Web

Rename a web via the Tools section in each %WEBPREFSTOPIC% topic.  You may delete a web by moving it into a Trash web.  

---+++ Permissions

You may only rename a web if you have the following permissions
   * You must be allowed to rename and changes topics in the web you want to rename
   * You must be allowed to rename topics in the parent web of the web you want to rename
!   * If the web is a root web (i.e. it has no parent web) then you must have permission to both create and rename root webs. These permissions are controlled by the ALLOWROOTCHANGE preference, which can be set in [[%USERSWEB%.SitePreferences]].
   * If you move the web to another parent web you must be allowed to create and change topics in the new parent web.
   
When you rename a web Foswiki will try and update all links that refer to the old web. You should note that links only get updated in topics that you are allowed to edit. If you use access rights in the Foswiki installation it is generally best to let an administrator rename webs to avoid too many broken links. 

---+++ Edit Conflicts

If anyone is editing a topic which requires updating, or which lives in the web being renamed, a second confirmation screen will come up which will indicate which topics are still locked for edit.  You may continue to hit the refresh button until an edit lease is obtained for each topic which requires updating (the "Refresh" button will change to "Submit"), or hit "Cancel", which will cancel your edit lease on all affected topics.

---+++ Renaming the webs in the distribution

It is possible, though not recommended, to change the names of the webs in the distribution.

If you plan to rename the %USERSWEB% web, remember that Foswiki stores user topics in this web. That means that every WikiName signature - =%USERSWEB%.<nop>SomeUserName= - points to it and would need updating (unless the macro style =%<nop>USERSWEB%.<nop>SomeUserName=, is used throughout). This potentially large change can be performed automatically if you rename the web from the Tools section of %WEBPREFSTOPIC%, as described above.

%X% If you want to rename the %SYSTEMWEB% or %USERSWEB% webs, remember they are referred to in the Foswiki configuration. You will need to change the ={SystemWebName}=, ={UsersWebName}= and/or ={LocalSitePreferences}= settings in the configuration using the [[%SCRIPTURL{configure}%][configure]] interface.

%X% Renaming the webs in the distribution is not recommended because it makes upgrades much more complicated.
