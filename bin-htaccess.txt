# Sample bin/.htaccess file.   If you require .htaccess files for your apache
# configuration, tailor this file using the below instructions.
#
############### TAILORING INSTRUCTIONS #################
#
# This file controls access to Foswiki scripts - to make Apache use it, rename this
# file to 'bin/.htaccess' and REPLACE THE FOLLOWING STRINGS WHEREVER YOU SEE
# THEM IN THIS FILE WITH PATHS SPECIFIC TO YOUR INSTALLATION.
# Most required values have corresponding items in the  Path Settings section of
# configure.   The following 5 strings must be updated:
#
# {DataDir}
# {WorkingDir}
# {DefaultUrlHost}
# {ScriptUrlPath}
# {Administrators}
#
# Replace {DataDir} with the full path of the Topic files store (file path, not
# URL) e.g. /usr/local/foswiki/data   Do not include a trailing slash.  Do not
# include the { or } in the results.
#
# Example:   "Change all"  {DataDir} /var/www/foswiki/data
#   AuthUserFile {DataDir}/.htpasswd      becomes
#   AuthUserFile /var/www/foswiki/data/.htpasswd
#
# Replace {WorkingDir} with the full path of a workarea directory (file path,
# no URL)  e.g. /usr/local/foswiki/working   Do not include a trailing slash.
# This directory MUST NOT BE ACCESSIBLE VIA THE WEB!
#
# Replace {DefaultUrlHost} with the root of all Foswiki URLs e.g.
# http://myhost.com:123.  This is only used for htdigest authentication and
# can be ignored in most installations.  Do not include a trailing slash
#
# Replace {ScriptUrlPath} with the 'cgi-bin' part of URLs used
# to access the Foswiki bin  directory e.g. '/foswiki/cgi-bin'
#
# Note:  The combined {DefaultUrlHost}{ScriptUrlPath} will be used as the URL prefix:
# to access the foswiki scripts.  For example, to access the /view script:
#    http://myhost.com:123/foswiki/cgi-bin/view
#    {DefaultUrlHost     }{ScriptUrlPath }/view
#
# Replace {Administrators} with a space-separated list of the login
# name(s) of the person(s) allowed to run the configure script
# e.g. admin configure root superhero
# Foswiki ships an example .htdigest file containing just the "admin" user.
# Other users must be added to .htdigest manually.  See the "htdigest" shell
# command provided by apache.
#
# Previous versions of Foswiki shared a common .htpasswd file between Wiki users and the
# configure admin user.  It is recommented to separate these roles.
#
# When this file has been completely tailored, complete your configuration at:
# {DefaultUrlHost}{ScriptUrlPath}/configure

##################################

# We set an environment variable called anonymous_spider
# Setting a BrowserMatchNoCase to ^$ is important. It prevents Foswiki from
# including its own topics as URLs and also prevents other Foswikis from
# doing the same. This is important to prevent the most obvious
# Denial of Service attacks.
# You can expand this by adding more BrowserMatchNoCase statements to
# block evil browser agents trying the impossible task of mirroring a Foswiki
# Example:
# BrowserMatchNoCase ^SiteSucker anonymous_spider
BrowserMatchNoCase ^$ anonymous_spider

# Now set default access rights.

# Use CGI & Perl to handle all files in 'bin' directory, i.e. run as scripts -
# this should remove the need to rename files to end in '.pl' etc, if your web
# hosting provider permits this.  Remove if using mod_perl.  Look at
# http://foswiki.org/Extensions/FastCGIEngineContrib to get info about FastCGI
# support.

#for LDAP password support uncomment the following (and fix up the paths)
#AuthLDAPURL ldap://yourldapserver/dc=yourldapserver,dc=com?uid?sub?(objectClass=posixAccount)
#AuthLDAPGroupAttribute memberUid

# By convention this is the UserRegistration page, that allows users
# to register with the Foswiki. Apache requires this to be a *local* path.
# Comment this out if you setup Foswiki to completely deny access to WikiGuest
# in all webs or change the path to a static html page.

# Alternatively if your users are all known to be registered you may want
# to redirect them to the ResetPassword page. Only uncomment one of these
# lines:

ErrorDocument 401 {ScriptUrlPath}/view/System/UserRegistration
# ErrorDocument 401 {ScriptUrlPath}/view/System/ResetPassword

    # in the data directory.

# NB. The resetpasswd & passwd scripts are used to reset and change passwords.
# They do their own validation of the user and therefore
