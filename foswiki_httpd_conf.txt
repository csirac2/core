# Example httpd.conf file for Foswiki.
#
# You are recommended to take a copy of this file and edit
# the paths to match your installation. Most Linux distributions are setup so
# Apache includes all config files that ends with .conf within a specific
# directory. If your distribution does not have this feature then add:
# include "/var/www/foswiki/foswiki_httpd.conf"
# to the end of your main httpd.conf file.
#
# See also http://foswiki.org/Support/ApacheConfigGenerator
# that helps you configure Apache

# The first parameter will be part of the URL to your installation e.g.
# http://example.com/foswiki/bin/view/...
# The second parameter must point to the physical path on your disk. Be
# careful not to lose any trailing /'s.

#### Change the _second_ path to match your local installation
ScriptAlias /foswiki/bin "/var/www/foswiki/bin"

# This defines a url that points to the pub directory of the foswiki installation. It is
# used to access files in the pub directory (attachments etc)
# It must come _after_ the ScriptAlias.
Alias /foswiki/pub "/var/www/foswiki/pub"

# This enables access to the documents in the Foswiki root directory
<Directory "/var/www/foswiki">
    Order Allow,Deny
    Allow from all
    Deny from env=blockAccess
</Directory>

# This alias enables access to the documents in the Foswiki root directory.
# You may comment this out if you do not desire that people have this access.
#### Change the path to match your local installation
Alias /foswiki "/var/www/foswiki"

# Block access to typical spam related attachments (.htm and .html files)
# Except the Foswiki directory which is read only and does have attached html files.
# You should uncomment the two lines below if the Foswiki is on the public Internet
#SetEnvIf Request_URI "/foswiki/pub/.*\.[hH][tT][mM][lL]?$" blockAccess
#SetEnvIf Request_URI "/foswiki/pub/System/.*\.[hH][tT][mM][lL]?$" !blockAccess

# We set an environment variable called blockAccess.
#
# Setting a BrowserMatchNoCase to ^$ is important. It prevents Foswiki from
# including its own topics as URLs and also prevents other Foswikis from
# doing the same. This is important to prevent the most obvious
# Denial of Service attacks.
#
# You can expand this by adding more BrowserMatchNoCase statements to
# block evil browser agents trying the impossible task of mirroring a Foswiki.
# http://foswiki.org/Support/ApacheConfigGenerator has a good list
# of bad spiders to block.
#
# Example:
# BrowserMatchNoCase ^SiteSucker blockAccess
BrowserMatchNoCase ^$ blockAccess

# Setting the NO_FOSWIKI_SESSION environment variable prevents a
# session being created for the Google Search Appliance bot. This
# is useful if you have the Google Search Appliance installed on
# your intranet, as they can be very aggressive when indexing, creating
# a lot of session files and slowing Foswiki down.
# You can also set this environment variable for public sites, to
# prevent Google and other search engines' bots. However, these tend
# to index your site a lot less often than the Google Search Appliance.
